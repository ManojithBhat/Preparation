**1st Round: Technical**

The interview began with a brief introduction, followed by questions on **ACID properties** and **normalization**.
Most of the time was dedicated to **designing a database schema for a platform similar to BookMyShow**.

After presenting the schema, a few corrections were discussed.
Subsequently, several follow-up questions were asked based on the schema design, such as:

* How to display all theaters showing a particular movie (given a specific `movieId`).
* How to find the number of screens in which a given movie (`movieId`) is currently running.

**2nd Round: Technical**

In this round, two tables were provided:

* **state**: (`stateId`, `name`)
* **student**: (`studentId`, `stateId`, `name`)

A query had to be written to **display the state name with the maximum number of students**.
The solution involved using clauses such as **SELECT**, **FROM**, **WHERE**, **GROUP BY**, **HAVING**, **ORDER BY**, and **LIMIT**.

The second question was the **Coin Change 2 problem**. All questions were solved on the **HackerRank** platform.
A **dry run** was performed on the recursive code, followed by a discussion on possible **optimizations**.

The third question involved a **logical puzzle**:
There are *n* trees arranged in a circular fashion. One monkey starts at position *X* and jumps to the next tree, while another monkey starts at *Y* and jumps to alternate trees. The task was to determine for what values of *n*, *x*, and *y* they would meet at the same tree, and for what values they would not.
Later, the question was reframed to **prove mathematically that the monkeys will always meet at one point, regardless of the values of *x* and *y***.

**3rd Round: Techno-Managerial**

This round began with an introduction covering my **educational background**, **experiences**, and a detailed discussion about my **summer internship at Verint**.
Conceptual questions included the **difference between a Primary Key and a Unique Key**.
I was also asked **why I was seeking this opportunity**, whether I had used any **Generative AI platforms**, and about **recent projects I am currently working on**.

The interviewer then shared insights about the **company, its performance, and services**, before concluding with an open discussion and questions from my side.
