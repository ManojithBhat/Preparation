**Verint Interview Experience**


### Round 1: Technical
The interview began with a general introduction, and the interviewer reviewed my resume. They asked me how my projects differed from each other and requested a detailed explanation of one project I built using Firebase. I was also asked to explain Firebase itself.

A follow-up question was about scaling up to 10,000 users. Since Firebase alone wouldn't be sufficient, I described a general approach involving caching, scaling, and load balancing. The interviewer asked me to explain the concept of scaling in detail, followed by a question about microservices (to which I responded that I wasnâ€™t familiar with the concept). He then asked about my familiarity with cloud services like Azure or AWS.

One question was about handling features with varying request volumes, such as posting and watching reels on Instagram, versus lower-demand features like signup and login. He asked how I would design the system to manage all these requests efficiently.

Next, I was asked to design a system of my choice, for which I chose to outline Medium's structure. We also discussed the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, as well as distinctions between data structures like maps, linked lists, and arrays.

The round concluded with questions about my proficiency in various programming languages.

**Result**: I received a call from the hiring manager for the next round a couple of hours later.



### Round 2: Techno-Managerial Round
The round began with a general introduction, where I was asked to explain my internship project. Since I had completed internships at both a large firm and a startup, he asked about the similarities I noticed between the two environments and what I learned from each experience.

I was then asked to explain one of my Firebase-based projects, which led to a detailed discussion about the services Firebase provides, such as Firebase Storage, Firestore, and Authentication. I was asked to design an authentication system, during which I mentioned OAuth. This prompted questions on how OAuth works, as well as JWT, sessions, cookies, and how to use them with authentication, where I explained the roles of middleware and controllers.

He also asked me to explain the inner workings of Microsoft Teams calls (the platform we were using for the interview). I described the use of WebSockets and discussed the TCP handshake, connections, sockets, and ports.

Additional questions covered the differences between Docker and virtual machines, the distinctions between SQL and NoSQL databases, and my preference for backend or frontend development. We also discussed my contributions to Hacktoberfest.

The round concluded with a question about my future goals and ended on a positive note.

### Result
I received a call from the hiring manager just two minutes later for the next round.



### Round 3: HR Round
The HR round began with a request to introduce myself, including details about my education, family background, schooling, and hobbies. The interview concluded with a discussion about the company.


### Final result : got shortlisted : uffff
